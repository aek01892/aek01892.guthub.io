    " In the summer of my final year of High School I embarked on the huge task to receive my Girl Scout Gold Award; 
    the highest award a scout like myself can earn. I looked around my community and found that the history that surrounded it was 
    underappreciated. And so with the help from my friends, family, scouts and 
    of course my community I created a video tour guide of Watkinsville's own Eagle Tavern. " -Addie Kelly </p>

       


<p>

    <h4 style=text-align:center> I started by meeting with the Tourism Director of the Watkinsville Visitor Center, Alex Pershcka who approved of the plan. Later I raised over $800 dollars from company sponsors in order to film. In order to write a script for the video I met with one of the writers for GPB ( Georgia Public Broadcasting ) With a scirpt, videogrpaher, and cast at hand we met at the Eagle Tavern at 6 am to 4 pm in order to film the tour guide of every single room in the buidling. With a lot of hard work and plenty of re-runs I had made a video tour guide of historic Eagle Tavern for the members of my community to educate and enjoy. </h4>
